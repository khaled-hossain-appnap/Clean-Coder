### A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers

## Foreword

Several years ago I was working at a medium-sized corporation selling highly regulated products. We were operating in a very competitive market when the government opened up a new product. Suddenly we had an entirely new set of potential customers; all we had to do was to get them to buy our product. That meant we had to file by a certain deadline with the federal government.

Over and over again our management stressed to us the importance of those dates. A single slip and the government would keep us out of the market for a year, and if customers couldn't sign up on day one, then they would all sign up with someone else and we'd be out of business.

I was a technical project manager, My partner Joe was business-facing project manager. Things to do

- met technical team every day
- rebuild the schedule every single day
- figure out critical oath, then remove every possible obstacle
- if someone needed software; we'd go get it.
- "gosh,it's time for lunch break", we would buy them lunch.
- we kicked over chairs, yelled and screamed but we did use every singe technique in our bag to get things done
- wrote SQL statement
- did pair programming

on launch day. We were done. \*Done\*. We were proud. Then Joe dropped by. He said something like, "Bad news, Legal doesn't have the enrollment forms ready, so we can't go live yet."

This was no big deal; Legal is on the third floor, we will push them to make it done. Then things got weird. Instead of agreeing with me, Joe asked, "What are you talking about Matt?". I said "You know. Our usual song and dance. We're talking about four PDF files, right? that are done; legal just has to approve them? Let's go hand out in their cubicles, give them the evil eye, and get this thing done!"

Joe did not agree with my assessment, and answered, "We'll just go live later next week. No big deal."

Matt: "But why? They could do this in a couple hours."

Joe: "It might take more than that."

Matt: "But they've got all weekend. Plenty of time. Let's do this!"

Joe: "Matt, these are professionals. We can't just stare them down and insist they sacrifice their personal lives for our little project."

Matt: (pause) "...Joe... what do you think we've been doing to the engineering team for the past four months?"

Joe: "Yes, but these are professionals."

Pause.

Breathe.

What. Did. Joe. Just. Say?

At the time, I thought the technical staff were professionals, in the best sense of the word.

Thinking back over it again, Shouldn't we have been able to ask the staff when they would be done, get a firm answer, believe the answer we were given, and not be burned by that belief?

Certainly, for professionals, we should... and at the same time, we could not. Joe didn't trust our answers and felt comfortable micromanaging the tech team and at the same time, for some reason, he did trust the legal team and was not willing to micromanage them.

What's that all about?

Somehow, the legal team had demonstrated professionalism in a way the technical team had not.

Somehow, another group had convinced Joe that they did not need a babysitter, that they were not playing games, and that they needed to be treated as peers who were respected. Ever since that day, I've wondered how the technical profession would have to change in order to be regarded as professionals.

Joe and me, once more on the big web site conversion project.

Only this time, imagine it just a little bit diferently.

- Instead of shirking from comitments, the technical staff actually makes them.
- Instead of shirking from estimates or letting someone else do the planning (then complaining about it), the technical team actually self-organizes and makes real commitments.

Now imagine that the staff is actually working together. When the programmers are blocked by operations, they pick up the phone and the sysadmin actually gets started on the work.

When Joe comes by a light a fire to get ticket 14321 worked on, he doesn't need to; he can see that the DBA is working diligently, not surfing the web or using FB. Likewise, the estimates he gets from staff seems downright consistent, and he doesn't get the feeling that the project is in priority somewhere between lunch and checking email.

All the tricks and attempts to manupulate the schedule are not met with "We'all try," but instead, "That's our commitment; if you want to make up your own goals, feel free."

After a while, I syspect Joe would start to think of the technical team as, well, professionals, And he'd be right.

Those steps to transform your behavior from technician to professional?
