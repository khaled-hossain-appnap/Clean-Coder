You want to hold your head high and declare to the world: "I am a professional!". you want people to look at you with respect and treat you with defence.

# Be Careful What You Ask For

Professionalism is a loaded term. Certainly it is a badge of honor and price, but it is also a marker of responsibility and accountability. The two go hand in hand.

it's lot easier to be a nonprofessional, they don't take responsibility but professional makes a mistake, he cleans up the mess.

What would happen if you allowed a bug to slip through a module and it cost your company $10,000? The nonprofessional would shrug his shoulders, say "stuff happens" and start writting the next module. The professional would write the company a check for $10,000!

yeah, it feels a little different when it's your own money, doesn't it? But that feeling is the feeling a professional has all the time.

# Taking Responsiblity

I worked for a telecom company named Teradyne. He sent new release fixed some minor defects and added a new feature that our customers had been demanding. We had told them we would provide that new feature by a certain date. I barely managed to overnight the software so that they'd arrive on the promised date.

Two days later I got a call from our field service manager, Tom. He told me that several customers had complained their telecom service is not recording any data. My heart sank because in order to ship the software on time, I had to neglect to test the routine.

I phoned Tom to tell him that I could duplicate the problem. I was working on it. In the meantime I told him that the customers should go back to the old software. He was angry at me saying that this was a doubble blow to the customers. since they'd lost a whole night's worth of data and couldn't use the new feature they were promised.

The bug was hard to find, it took me several days, to figure out what had gone wrong. The whole time, Tom was calling me every few hours asking me when I'd have this fixed. he also made sure I knew about the earfuls he was getting from area managers, and just how embarrasing it was for him to tell them to put the old software back.

In the end, i found the defect, shipped the new tapes and everything went back to normal. My boss came to me when it was over and said, "I bet you aren't going to do that again." I agreed.

Upon reflection I realized that shipping without testing the routine had been irresponsible. The reason I neglected the test was so I could say I had shipped on time; It was about me saving face. I had not been concerned about the customer, nor about my employer. I had only been concerned about my own reputation. I should have taken respnsibility early and told Tom that the tests weren't complete and that I was not prepared to ship the software on time. That would have been hard, and Tom would have been upset. But no customers would have lost data, and my boss would not have lost the deal.

# First, Do No Harm

In order to be professional, we must not create bugs. "But wait!" I hear you say "That's not reasonable. Software is too complex to create without bugs."

Of course you are right. Software is too complex to create without bugs. Unfortunately that doesn't let you off the hook. The human body is too complex to understand in it's entirety, but doctors still take an oath to do no harm. If they don't take themselves off a hook like that, how can we?

"Are you telling us we must e perfect?" No, I'm telling you that you must be responsible for your imperfections. The fact that bugs will certainly occur in your code does not mean you aren't responsiblie for them.

It is the lot of a professional to be accountable for errors even though errors are virtually certain. So, my aspiring professional, the first thing you must practice is aplogizing. Aplogies are necessary, but insufficient. You cannot simply keep making the same errors over and over. As you mature in your profession, your error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero. It won't get zero but it is your responsibility to get as close as possible to it.
